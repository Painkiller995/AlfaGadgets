# Why AlfaGadgets

Why AlfaGadgets? i can use Rainmeter instead.

Yep, you can use Rainmeter, but the main problem in this program are the resolution.

if you use AlfaGadgets you will get realtime gadget render, thank to microsoft sidebar and 8gadgetpack maker who did alot of work to make it run on windows 10.

**Note:** all gadgets will work immediately except Network meter because you have to give the dll permission.
